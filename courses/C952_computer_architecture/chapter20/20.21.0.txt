Four processors (1, 2, 3, and 4) have clock frequencies of 100 Mhz, 200 Mhz, 300 Mhz, and 500 Mhz, respectively. 

Suppose:
Processor 1 can execute an instruction with an average of 4 steps.
Processor 2 can execute an instruction with an average of 2 steps.
Processor 3 can execute an instruction with an average of 2 steps.
Processor 4 can execute an instruction with an average of 4 steps.

1) Which processor should be selected to improve performance for the execution of the same instruction set? 

Processor 1
Processor 2
Processor 3 x
Processor 4
