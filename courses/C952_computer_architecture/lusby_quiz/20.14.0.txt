A protein string matching code takes 4 days to execute. 35% of computational time is spent doing integer instructions and 65% of the time is spent doing I/O. Which of the following is an example of strong scaling? Which is an example of weak scaling?

1) Reducing computational time by 100% results in reducing computational time by 14 days when the code is run 10 times

strong scaling
weak scaling x

HINT: Strong scaling is the improvement you get on a single problem. So the total improvement is bound by the part you don’t improve.


2) Reducing computational time by 100% results in reducing computational time by 1.4 days or a speedup of 53.85%.
