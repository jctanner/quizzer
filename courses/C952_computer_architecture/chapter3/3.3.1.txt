Example 3.3.1: Compiling a C Assignment Using Registers.

It is the compiler's job to associate program variables with registers. Take, for instance, the assignment statement from our earlier example:

	f = (g + h) - (i + j);

The variables f, g, h, i, and j are assigned to the registers X19, X20, X21, X22, and X23, respectively. What is the compiled LEGv8 code?

Answer

The compiled program is very similar to the prior example, except we replace the variables
with the register names mentioned above plus two temporary registers, X9 and X10, which
correspond to the temporary variables above:

	ADD X9, X20, X21	// register X9 contains g + h
	ADD X10, X22, X23	// register X10 contains i + j
	SUB X19, X9, X10	// f gets X9 - X10, which is (g + h) - (i + j)


1) With what register did the compiler associate variable g?

X20 x
X19

HINT: The example stated that g was associated with X20, which is also consistent with the instruction ADD X9, X20, X21 computing g + h.

2) Could the compiler have associated g with X26, assuming X26 wasn't used for something else?

Yes x
No

HINT: The compiler can use any available register for each variable.
