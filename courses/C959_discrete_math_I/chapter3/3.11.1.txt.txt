Which of the following Boolean expressions are satisfiable? If an expression is satisfiable, then give an assignment to the variables that causes the expression to evaluate to 1.

1) (¬x + ¬z)(x + y)(¬y + z)

True x
False

HINT: Satisfiable: the assignment x = 1, y = z = 0 is a satisfying assignment. The assignment x = 0, y = z = 1 is also a satisfying assignment.

2) (¬x + ¬z)(x + y)(¬y + z)(x + ¬y + ¬z)

True x
False

HINT: Satisfiable: x = 1, y = z = 0.

3) (¬x + ¬z)(x + y)(¬y + z)(x + ¬y + ¬z)(¬x + y + z)

True
False x

HINT: Not satisfiable.

4) (¬x + ¬z)(x + y)(¬y + z)(x + ¬y + ¬z)(¬x + y + ¬z)

True x
False

HINT: Satisfiable: x = 1, y = z = 0.
