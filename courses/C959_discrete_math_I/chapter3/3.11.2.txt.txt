Are the following functions boolean satisfiable(SAT)? Try finding variables values that cause f = 1, or use logic to conclude f can never be 1.

1) f(x, y, z) = xy + z

True x
False

HINT: If z =1, then f =1. Likewise, if x = 1 and y = 1, then f = 1.

2) f(x, y) = x¬x + y¬y

True
False x

HINT: The first term can never be 1, because x can't be both 1 and 0. Likewise, the second term can never be 1. So f can never be 1.

3) f(x, y) = (x + y)¬x

True x
False

HINT: If y = 1 and x = 0, then f = 1.
