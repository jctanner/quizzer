1) The expression ∃x P(x) is a proposition.

True x
False

HINT: The variable x is bound, so the statement is either true or false.

2) The expression (∃x S(x)) ∨ R(x) is a proposition.

True
False x

HINT: The variable x in R(x) is a free variable, so the statement is not a proposition.

3) The expression ∃x (S(x) ∨ R(x)) has a free variable.

True
False x

HINT: Both occurrences of x are bound by the existential quantifier.

4) The expression ∀x P(x) ∨ ∃x Q(x) is a proposition.

True x
False

HINT: The quantifier ∀ binds the variable x in P(x). Therefore ∀x P(x) is a proposition. The quantifier ∃ binds the variable x in Q(x). Therefore ∃x Q(x) is a proposition. ∀x P(x) ∨ ∃x Q(x) is the disjunction of two propositions and is therefore a proposition.
