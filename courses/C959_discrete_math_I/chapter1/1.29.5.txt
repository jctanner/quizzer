Below are the steps for a proof by contradiction of the following theorem:

Theorem: There is no smallest positive real number.

* Assume there is a smallest positive real number called r.
* Since r is positive, r/2 is also positive. Since r is positive, r > r/2.
* r/2 is a positive real number that is smaller than r.
* This contradicts the assumption that r is the smallest positive real number.
