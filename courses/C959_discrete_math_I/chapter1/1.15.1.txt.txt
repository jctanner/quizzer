For the following questions, the domain for the variable x is the set of all positive integers. The first three questions use predicates O and M which are defined as follows:

O(x): x is odd
M(x): x is an integer multiple of 4 (e.g., 4, 8, 12,...)

Indicate whether each quantified statement is true or false:

1) ∃x (O(x) ∧ M(x))

True
False x

2) ∃x (¬O(x) ∧ ¬M(x))

True x
False

3) ∀x (M(x) → ¬O(x))

True x
False

4) ∀x ((x = 1) ∨ (x2 ≠ x))

True x
False
