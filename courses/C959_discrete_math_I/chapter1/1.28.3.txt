Theorem: For every positive integer x, if x^3 is even, then x is even.

According to contrapositive ...

Let x be a positive integer. Assume A. We will prove that B.

If x is odd, then it can be written as C for some integer k. Plug in the expression for x into x3 to get D. The expression for x3 can be written as E. Since (4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) is an integer, we can conclude that x^3 is odd.

1) What is the correct expression for A?

x^3 is even
x^3 is odd
x is even
x is odd x

2) What is the correct expression for B?

x^3 is even
x^3 is odd x
x is even
x is odd

3) What is the correct expression for C?

2k
2k+1 x
k^3

HINT: An odd integer is equal to 2k+1 for some integer k.

4) What is the correct expression for D?

8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1
8k^3


5) What is the best expression for E? Both choices are equal to x^3, but one does a better job showing x^3 is odd.

2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1 x
8k^3 12k^2 + 6k + 1

HINT: The goal is to show that x^3 can be expressed as 2c+1 for some integer c.
