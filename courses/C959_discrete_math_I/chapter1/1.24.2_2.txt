The difference of two odd integers is even.

1) Which of the expressions is equivalent to the statement above?

if x and y are integers and x and y are both odd, then (x-y) is even. x
if x and y are integers and (x-y) is odd, then x is even or y is even.
if x and y are integers and x and y are both even, then (x-y) is odd.

HINT: The hypothesis of the statement is that there are two integers that are odd. The conclusion is that their difference (x - y) is even.
