Below is a list of false statements. Match each assignment to the statement for which it is a counterexample.

1) For every integer x such that x > 1, 2^x < x^2

x = -1
x = 1
x = 5 x

2) For all real numbers x, x ≠ x^2

x = -1
x = 1 x
x = 5

3) For all real numbers x, -x ≠ x^2

x = -1 x
x = 1
x = 5
