Consider the following statement:

For every real number x, if 0 ≤ x ≤ 3, then 15 - 8x + x^2 > 0

1) What would be the starting assumption in a direct proof of the statement above?

0 <= x <= 3 x
15 - 8x + x^2 > 0
15 - 8x + x^2 <= 0

2) What would be proven in a direct proof of the statement, given the assumption?

0 <= x <= 3
15 - 8x + x^2 > 0 x
15 - 8x + x^2 <= 0

3) What would be the starting assumption in a proof by contrapositive of the statement above?

0 <= x <= 3
15 - 8x + x^2 > 0
15 - 8x + x^2 <= 0 x

4) What would be proven in a proof by contrapositive of the statement, given the assumption?

0 <= x <= 3
x < 0 or x > 3 x
x < 0 and x < 3

HINT: It is impossible for a number x to be less than 0 and greater than 3. In a proof by contrapositive, one needs to show that the hypothesis is false.
