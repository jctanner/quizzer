Indicate whether the functions defined below are injective, surjective, neither, or both:

1) h: Z → Z. h(x) = x - 4.

neither injective nor surjective
injective but not surjective
surjective but not injective
both injective and surjective x

2) t: Z → Z. t(x) = 2x.

neither injective nor surjective
injective but not surjective x
surjective but not injective
both injective and surjective

3) f: Z → Z. f(x) = [(x+1)/2]

neither injective nor surjective
injective but not surjective
surjective but not injective x
both injective and surjective
