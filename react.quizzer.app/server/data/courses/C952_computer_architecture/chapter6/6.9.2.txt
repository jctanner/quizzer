1) The cache controller is designed using a _____ .

truth table
finite-state machine x

HINT: The cache controller requires multistep control for which a finite state machine model is well-suited.

2) A finite-state machine consists of a combinational control logic block and a temporary register used to hold the _____ state.

current
next x
previous

HINT: The current state specify which control signals are asserted. The current state and inputs to the combinational control logic are used to determine the next state.
