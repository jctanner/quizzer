1) A program runs alone on a CPU. The CPU clock rate is 5e9 cycles per second, i.e., 5 GHz. It takes 12e10 clock cycles to complete the program. How many seconds is the CPU performance for the task?

2.4
24 x
240
6.0

600

HINT: In this problem, we are given the total number of clock cycles. (number of cycles = instruction count * CPI). So we don't need the instruction count or the CPI ... cpu time = ((12 * 10^10)/(5 * 10^9) = 24
