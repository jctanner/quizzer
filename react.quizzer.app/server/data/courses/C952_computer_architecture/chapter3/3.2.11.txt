Indicate whether each name refers to a LEGv8 register.

1) X0

True x
False

2) X32

True 
False x

HINT: X30 is the highest-numbered X register.

3) X

True
False x

HINT: The X must be followed by a number 0-30, or ZR.

4) XZR

True x
False

HINT: The XZR register always contains 0 (ZR is short for ZERO), which can be convenient for assembly programmers.

5) XONE

True
False x

6) Memory[0]

True
False x

HINT: Memory[0] refers to a memory location, not a register. A register is a fast location for data, but only relatively few registers exist in LEGv8. In contrast, over 4 quintillion memory locations exist in MIPS.
