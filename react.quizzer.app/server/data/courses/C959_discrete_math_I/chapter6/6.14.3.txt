1) Are f and D comparable?

True x
False

HINT: There is a single segment between f and d

2) Are C and A comparable?

True
False x

HINT: There is no path of line segments connecting c and a

3) Are H and E comparable?

True
False x

HINT: The only paths of line segments connecting h and e change directions. The path form h to a to e goes up and then down.

4) Are G and A comparable?

True
False x

HINT: The only paths of line segments connecting g and a change directions. The path from a to b to g goes up and then down. The path from a to e to g goes down and then up.

5) Are B and E comparable?

True x
False

HINT: The path from e to a to b travels only upwards along line segments.
