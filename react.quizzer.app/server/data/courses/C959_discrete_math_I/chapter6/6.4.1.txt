Define the relation R on Z+, the set of positive integers as follows:

	aRb if a and b are relatively prime (that is, the only positive integer that evenly divides both is a and b is 1)

1) 8R12

True
False x

2) 2120

True x
False

3) There is a number such that x != 1 and xRx

True 
False x


4) There is a number x such that xR7

True x
False
