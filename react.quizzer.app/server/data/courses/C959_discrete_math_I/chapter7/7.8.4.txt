Refer to the undirected graph provided below:

1) Which of the following sequence of vertices is a circuit in the graph?

a,b,e,b
a,e,f,g,e,a
a,e,f,g,a x
b,g,f,c,b

HINT: This sequence is a closed walk with no repeated edges there fore the sequence is a circuit.

2) Which of the following sequence of vertices is a trail in the graph?

a,b,e,b
a,e,f,g,e,b,a
a,e,f,g,e,b x

HINT: The sequence of vertices is an open walk in which no edge occurs more than once, so the sequence is a trail.

3) Is the following walk a path? a,e,f,g,e

True
False x

HINT: vertex E is repeated in the walk, therefore is is not a path.

4) Is the following closed walk a cycle? a,b,c,f,e,a

True x
False

HINT: No edge can occur more than once.
