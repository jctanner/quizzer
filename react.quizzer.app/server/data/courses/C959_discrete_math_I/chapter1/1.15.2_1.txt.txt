Predicates P and Q are defined below. The domain of discourse is the set of all positive integers.

P(x): x is prime
Q(x): x is a perfect square (i.e., x = y^2, for some integer y)

Indicate whether each logical expression is a proposition.

a) ∃x Q(x)

True x
False

b) ∀x Q(x) ∧ ¬P(x)

True
False x

HINT: Not a proposition because the variable x in P(x) is not bound by the quantifier.

c) ∀x Q(x) ∨ P(3)

True x
False

HINT: Proposition. The proposition is true. ∀x Q(x) is false because not every positive integer is a perfect square, but P(3) is true because 3 is prime. Therefore ∀x Q(x) ∨ P(3) is true.

d) ∃x (Q(x) ∧ P(x))

True x
False

HINT: Proposition. The proposition is false because there is no positive integer that is a perfect square and prime.

e) ∀x (¬Q(x) ∨ P(x))

True x
False

HINT: Proposition. The proposition is false. One possible counterexample is x = 4.
