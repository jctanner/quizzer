1) Let X = { u, v, w, x }. Define a function g: X → X to be: g = { (u, v), (v, w), (w, x), (x, u) }. What is g^-1(x)?

u
v
w x
x

HINT: g(w) = x. Therefore, g^-1(x) = w.

2) Let h: {0, 1}3 → {0, 1}3. For x ∈ {0, 1}3, h(x) is obtained by moving the middle bit of x to the beginning of x. For example, h(101) = 011. What is h^-1(100)?

010 x
100
001
111

HINT: h(010) = 100. Therefore, h^-1(100) = 010.
