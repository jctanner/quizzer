According to each definition of functions f and g, is true that f = g?

1) f: R → R, f(x) = x^2 + 1

	g: R → R+, g(x) = (x + 1)^2 - 2x

equal
not equal

2) f: R → R, f(x) = |x|

	g: R → R, g(x) = sqrt(x^2)

equal x
not equal

3) X = {0, 1, 2}

	f: X → X, f(x) = (x - 1)^2
	g: X → X, g(0) = 1, g(1) = 0, g(2) = 1

equal x
not equal
