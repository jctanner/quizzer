  "answer": "For every outcome of the red die, there are three outcomes of the blue die that cause the sum to be even. (If the red die is even, the blue die must also be even. If the red die is odd, the blue die must also be odd.) Therefore |A| = 18. The size of the sample space is 36, and p(A) = 18/36 = 1/2.",
