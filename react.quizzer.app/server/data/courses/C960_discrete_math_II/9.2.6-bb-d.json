  "question": "An urn contains two black balls (B1 & B2) and one white ball. A second urn contains one black ball and two white balls (W1 & W2). One urn is chosen at random. Next a ball is chosen at random from the urn. Then a second ball is chosen from the same urn without replacing the first ball. What is probability that two balls of opposite color are chosen?",
