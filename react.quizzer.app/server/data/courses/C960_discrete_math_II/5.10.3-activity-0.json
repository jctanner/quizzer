A test has been developed for the disease that is very accurate but has some likelihood of error. If a person with the disease is tested, the test results say the person does not have the disease with probability 0.01. If the person does not have the disease, the test is incorrect with probability 0.005. Let D be the event that the person has the disease. Let T be the event that the person tests positive for the disease.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that a \"positive\" test result means that the results indicate that the person has the disease.
