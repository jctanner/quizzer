Suppose that juice is sold in 2-packs or 5-packs. Let Q(n) be the statement that it is possible to buy n cans of juice by combining 2-packs and 5-packs. We can use the principle of well-ordering to show that for\n  <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n   n \u2265 4,\n  </span>\n  Q(n) is true.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "question": "<div>\n <div class=\"text\">\n  What is the contradiction that results if m = 4 or m = 5?\n </div>\n</div>", "correct_choice_index": 1, "choices": ["Since it is possible to buy 2 or 3 cans, just add an extra 2-pack to get 4 or 5 cans.", "It is possible to buy 4 cans (two 2-packs) and 5 cans (one 5-pack).
