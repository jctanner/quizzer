The gambler selects one of the two die at random and rolls the die  twice. \nThe outcomes of the two rolls are independent. The first outcome  is not a 6 and the second outcome is a 6. Define Y to be the event that two rolls of the die result in the first roll not coming up 6 and the second roll coming up 6.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Express probabilities as a simplified fraction (e.g., 0, 3/4 or 1/7, but not 4/8).\n </p>\n</div>\n", "question": "<div>\n <div class=\"text\">\n  Apply the results from the previous two questions to Bayes' Theorem to determine p(F|Y).\n </div>\n</div>", "correct_choice_index": null, "choices": [], "answer": "49/121", "explanation": "<div aria-atomic=\"true\" class=\"zb-explanation has-explanation forfeit\" role=\"alert\">\n <p class=\"message\">\n  Answer\n </p>\n <div class=\"answers\">\n  <!-- -->\n  <span class=\"forfeit-answer\">\n   49/121\n  </span>\n </div>\n The numerator is (5/36)(1/2).
