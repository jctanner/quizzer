The gambler selects one of the two die at random and rolls the die  twice. \nThe outcomes of the two rolls are independent. The first outcome  is not a 6 and the second outcome is a 6. Define Y to be the event that two rolls of the die result in the first roll not coming up 6 and the second roll coming up 6.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Express probabilities as a simplified fraction (e.g., 0, 3/4 or 1/7, but not 4/8).\n </p>\n</div>\n", "question": "<div>\n <div class=\"text\">\n  What is p(Y|\n  <span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">\n   F\n  </span>\n  )?\n </div>\n</div>", "correct_choice_index": null, "choices": [], "answer": "10/49", "explanation": null, "images": {"instructions": "5.10.2-activity-instructions_div.png", "question": "5.10.2.1-activity-question.png", "choices": []}}
