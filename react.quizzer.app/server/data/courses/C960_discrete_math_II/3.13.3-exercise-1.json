Since m \u2265 11, m - 3 \u2265 8. Therefore the value\nm - 3 lies in the range from 8 through  m - 1 and by definition of m, it is possible to make\nm - 3 cents worth of stamps using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps. By adding one more 3-cent stamps\nto a collection of stamps worth m - 3 cents, the collection of stamps is worth m cents. Therefore, it is possible\nto make m cents worth of stamps using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps.\u00a0\u25a0", "explanation": null}
