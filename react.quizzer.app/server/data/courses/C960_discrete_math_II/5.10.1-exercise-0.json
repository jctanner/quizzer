The biased coin comes up heads with probability .75 and tails with probability .25. She selects a coin at random and flips the coin ten times. The results of the coin flips are mutually independent. The result of the 10 flips is:\n   <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n    T,T,H,T,H,T,T,T,H,T.\n   </span>\n   What is the probability that she selected the biased coin?\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n",
