For example, the ordering\nshown above is an element in T.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now define a function f whose domain is S and whose target is T. Let x be an element of S, so\nx is one possible way to order the kids. If Gene is ahead of Don in the ordering x, then f(x) = x.\nIf Don is ahead of Gene in x, then f(x) is the ordering that is the same as x, except that  Don and Gene\nhave swapped places.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "input_type": null, "question": "<div class=\"question\">\n <span class=\"part\">\n  (e)\n </span>\n <div class=\"text\">\n  <p>\n   Let Q be the set of orderings in which Gene comes before Don and Jan comes before Abe\n(again, not necessarily immediately before).\nDefine a k-to-1 correspondence from S to Q.

For x \u2208 S, if Don comes before Gene in x, then swap Gene and Don. If Abe comes before Jan in x, then swap Abe and Jan. Otherwise make no changes to x.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The function g is a 4-to-1 correspondence. For a particular y \u2208 Q, there are at  least 4 line-ups that map to y:\nthe line-up y itself, the line-up y with Don and Gene swapped, the line-up y with Abe and Jan swapped,\nand the line-up y with Don and Gene swapped and Abe and Jan swapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Consider a line-up y \u2208 Q.\nLet i and j be the place in line of Gene and Don. (Gene is in the  i\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  place and\nDon is in the  j\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  place.) Then i &lt; j.\nSimilarly, let k and l be the place in line of Jan and Abe (Jan  is in the  k\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  place and\nAbe is in the  l\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  place.) Then k &lt; l.\nThere are exactly four line-ups in which Don and Gene occupy locations from {i, j} and\nJan and Abe occupy locations from {k, l}. The function g does not change the set of locations occupied by\nDon and Gene or the set of locations occupied by Jan and Abe. The function\ng also does not change the location in line of any of the other kids.\nTherefore the function g maps at most\n4 line-ups in S to a single line-up in Q.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is a 4-to-1 correspondence from S to Q. Therefore |Q| = |S|/4 = 3628800/4 = 907200.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "explanation": null}
