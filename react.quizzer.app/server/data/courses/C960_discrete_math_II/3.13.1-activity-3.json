Suppose that juice is sold in 2-packs or 5-packs. Let Q(n) be the statement that it is possible to buy n cans of juice by combining 2-packs and 5-packs. We can use the principle of well-ordering to show that for\n  <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n   n \u2265 4,\n  </span>\n  Q(n) is true.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "question": "<div>\n <div class=\"text\">\n  What is the contradiction that results if m \u2265 6?\n </div>\n</div>", "correct_choice_index": 0, "choices": ["It is possible to buy \n m - 2\n\n cans. m cans can be purchased by buying \n m - 2\n\n cans and adding a 2-pack.", "Q(6) is true because it is possible to buy 6 cans by purchasing three 2-packs."], "answer": "It is possible to buy m - 2 cans. m cans can be purchased by buying m - 2 cans and adding a 2-pack.", "explanation": "<div aria-atomic=\"true\" class=\"zb-explanation has-explanation correct\" role=\"alert\">\n <p class=\"message\">\n  Correct\n </p>\n Since m \u2265 6, m - 2 is  in the range from 4 to m-1, so Q(m - 2) is true and it is possible to buy m - 2 cans.
