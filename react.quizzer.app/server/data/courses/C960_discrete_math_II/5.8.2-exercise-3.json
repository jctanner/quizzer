  "answer": "A \u2229 B is the event that b is in the middle and c appears to  the right of  b. If b is in the middle, there are 3 possible locations for the c to the right of b. Once c is placed in one of those locations, there are 5! ways to permute the rest of the letters. Therefore |A \u2229 B| = 3\u00b75!. p(A|B) = |A \u2229 B|/|B| = (3\u00b75!)/(7!/2) = 3\u00b72\u00b75!/7! = 1/7.",
