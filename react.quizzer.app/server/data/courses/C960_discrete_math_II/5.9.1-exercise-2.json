  "answer": "The number of ways to order the people so that the maid of honor is in the leftmost position and the bride is next to the groom is 2\u00b76!. (Place the maid of honor on the left, then permute the remaining 6 people besides the groom and then place the groom to the left or right of the bride). The probability that the maid of honor is in the leftmost position and the bride is next to the groom is 2\u00b76!/8! = 1/28.  Since 1/28 \u2260 (1/4)(1/8), the two events are not independent.",
