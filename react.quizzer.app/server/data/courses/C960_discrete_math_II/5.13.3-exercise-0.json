Each of the six numbers is in the range from 1 through 50. The person purchasing a lottery ticket can select the numbers on their ticket. On each Friday of the week, the state lottery commission holds a drawing in which six random numbers are generated. Each number in the range from 1 through 50 is equally likely.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The order of the numbers matters, so if the random numbers selected are\n   <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n    (25, 7, 12, 37, 2, 19)\n   </span>\n   then the ticket\n   <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n    (7, 25, 12, 37, 20, 19)\n   </span>\n   matches in location 3, 4, and 6. If a ticket matches in all six locations, then the ticket holder wins\n   <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n    $100,000,000.\n   </span>\n   If the ticket matches in five of the six locations, then the ticket holder wins\n   <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n    $1,000,000.\n   </span>\n   The ticket holder does not win any money for any of the other outcomes.\nWhat are the expected winnings?\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "choices": [], "correct_choice_index": null, "answer": "", "explanation": null}
