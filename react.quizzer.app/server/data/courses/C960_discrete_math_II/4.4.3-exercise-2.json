  "answer": "The function is a 2-to-1 correspondence. Given a line-up x in which Gene appears before Don,\nthere are at least two line-ups that map to x: the line-up x itself and the line-up x with Gene and Don\nswitched.  The function f only changes the place in line for Gene and Don. For two particular\nlocations in line, there are only two ways to place Gene and Don in those two locations\n(Gene before Don or Don before Gene). Therefore at most two line-ups map to a particular line-up in\nwhich Gene is ahead of Don.",

For example,\none ordering might be:\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align:center\">\n  (Fran, Gene, Hal, Jan, Abe, Don, Cam, Eli, Ike, Ben)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The names are listed in order from left to right, so Fran is at the front of the line and Ben is at the end of the line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let T be the set of all possible ways to line up the kids in which Gene is ahead of Don in the line.\nNote that Gene does not have to be immediately ahead of Don. For example, the ordering\nshown above is an element in T.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now define a function f whose domain is S and whose target is T. Let x be an element of S, so\nx is one possible way to order the kids. If Gene is ahead of Don in the ordering x, then f(x) = x.\nIf Don is ahead of Gene in x, then f(x) is the ordering that is the same as x, except that  Don and Gene\nhave swapped places.\n </p>\n</div>\n",
