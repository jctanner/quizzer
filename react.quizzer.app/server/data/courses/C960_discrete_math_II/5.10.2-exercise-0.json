A test for the drugs has a false positive rate of 2% and a false negative rate of 4%. In other words,  a person who does not take the drugs will test positive with probability 0.02. A person who does take the drugs will test negative with probability 0.04. A randomly selected player is tested and tests positive. What is the probability that she really does take performance enhancing drugs?\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n",
