A valid password must be at least 10 characters long, and it must contain at least one character from each of the three sets of characters. What is the probability that a randomly selected string with exactly ten characters  results in a valid password? The alphabet for the strings in the sample space from which the string is drawn is the union of the three\nsets of characters.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font color=\"gray\" size=\"1\">\n    Source:\n    <a href=\"http://www.aduni.org/courses/discrete/\" target=\"_blank\">\n     ADUni\n    </a>\n    , modified by Sandy Irani.\n   </font>\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "choices": [], "correct_choice_index": null, "answer": "", "explanation": null, "images": {"instructions": "5.6.5-exercise-instructions_div.png", "question": "5.6.5.0-exercise-question.png", "choices": []}}
