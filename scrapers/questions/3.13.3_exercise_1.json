By the well-ordering principle, S has a smallest element m.\nSince any integer must be at least 8 to be in S, m \u2265 8. Also by definition of m, it is impossible\nto make m cents worth of stamps and for any j in the range 8 through m-1, it is\npossible to make j cents worth of stamps. For each of the following cases, we\nobtain a contradiction:\n </p>\n <p>\n  m = 8: a 3-cent and a 5-cent stamp makes 8 cents worth of stamps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  m = 9: three  3-cent stamps makes 9 cents worth of stamps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  m = 10: two  5-cent stamps makes 10 cents worth of stamps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last case is that m \u2265 11. Since m \u2265 11, m - 3 \u2265 8. Therefore the value\nm - 3 lies in the range from 8 through  m - 1 and by definition of m, it is possible to make\nm - 3 cents worth of stamps using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps. By adding one more 3-cent stamps\nto a collection of stamps worth m - 3 cents, the collection of stamps is worth m cents. Therefore, it is possible\nto make m cents worth of stamps using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps.\u00a0\u25a0\n </p>\n</div>\n", "explanation": null}
