Suppose that juice is sold in 2-packs or 5-packs. Let Q(n) be the statement that it is possible to buy n cans of juice by combining 2-packs and 5-packs.

Therefore k - 2 falls in the range from 8 through k, and\nby the inductive hypothesis, it is possible to make\nk - 2 cents worth of stamps using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps. By adding one 3-cent stamp, the amount of postage\nbecomes (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1. Therefore, it is possible to make k + 1 cents worth of postage using only 3-cent and 5-cent stamps.\u00a0\u25a0\n </p>\n</div>\n", "explanation": null}
