Therefore k - 4 falls in the range from 24 through k, and\nby the inductive hypothesis, it is possible to make\nk - 4 cents worth of stamps using only 7-cent and 5-cent stamps. By adding one 5-cent stamp, the amount of postage\nbecomes (k - 4) + 5 = k + 1. Therefore, it is possible to make k + 1 cents worth of postage using only 7-cent and 5-cent stamps.\u00a0\u25a0\n </p>\n</div>\n", "explanation": null}
